### Agile Resources

#### The Agile Approach, Process, and Models

**Agile Discussion and Transformation**

"I promise not to exclude from consideration any idea based on its source, but to consider ideas across schools and heritages in order to find the ones that best suit the current situation."

**The Oath of Non-Allegiance**

**The Agile Approach**
An agile approach focuses on empowered, self-managing teams; autonomy that doesn't need day-to-day intervention by management. Instead, Agile management means protecting the team from outside interference and removing roadblocks that impede the delivery of business value and productivity.

**What Does It Mean to “Be Agile?”**
Agile is a set of values and principles, and becoming agile means upholding these values and principles. It's not about doing one practice (such as Kanban or Scrum) and declaring that you are Agile, it's about continually seeking better ways of achieving organizational goals. Your company must adopt an agile culture and implement practices based on the needs of your teams and projects.

**Agile Benefits Realized**
Why do businesses implement agile? Since 2007, VersionOne has conducted yearly surveys on the state of agile across industries and the globe to uncover the value. Consistently, the top reasons why companies and organizations adopt agile are to:

- Accelerate software delivery.
- Better manage changing priorities.
- Increase productivity.

The top benefits realized are the ability to:

- Manage changing priorities.
- Increase project visibility.
- Align business and IT.

The challenges and barriers to adopting and scaling agile are almost always cultural. You may find resistance to change, inconsistencies in process and practices, and lack of skills and experience with agile methods. This is common but can be overcome with practice and embracing a continuous improvement mindset.

**Agile + Lean**
Agile and lean go hand-in-hand for modern organizational teams. Agile is about fostering collaboration and communication, while Lean is about eliminating waste and focusing on delivering the most value at just the right time. The term lean came out of lean manufacturing with the model Toyota Production System pioneered to streamline production and improve delivery.

**The Agile Models**
Agile is not a set process or system, but a set of principles and values. When it comes to acting out the agile approach, the best model depends on the unique goals and problems of your organization and team. There are several popular models of agile, including:

- Kanban
- Scrum
- DevOps
- Crystal
- Xtreme Programming (XP)

**How to Select the Right Agile Model**
Consider specific circumstances to figure out what might be the best fit for each situation:

- Recognize that current processes, organizational structures, culture, and approaches are usually the key causes of throughput or quality problems—not your people.
- Coach your people on recognizing problems and challenges. Finding, identifying, and talking about these roadblocks is expected and encouraged.
- Select the processes and approaches best suited to help your organization, based on the problems and challenges being highlighted.

**Kanban**
In the 1950s, Taiichi Ohno began using Kanban in Toyota’s primary machine shop. Kanban is a visual scheduling system that helps a team determine what to produce, when to produce it, and how much to produce. 

To implement Kanban:

- Create a visual workflow and picture the product in each state—from concept to deployment.
- Develop rules to limit work in progress (WIP) to prevent your team from becoming overwhelmed and keep progress continuous and steady.
- Manage the flow to allow and prepare for changes that will occur within the iteration.
- Make the team, queue, and practice policies explicit so your team knows how to participate in the process properly, ensuring a smoother iteration.

**Scrum**
Scrum is an agile project management model that consists of small teams working interdependently. The teams work together but focus on their own tasks and must be capable of self-management and decision-making.

Key Aspects of Scrum:

- Scrum is based around a “sprint,” which is generally a 1-4 week period for delivering a working part of the system.
- The product owner creates and prioritizes a product backlog.
- A sprint (or iteration) is a short amount of time to get a significant amount of work done, and the team selects the duration.
- The team meets each day during a “daily scrum” to assess their progress.
- The Scrum Master keeps the team focused on their goals.
- Every sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.

**DevOps**
Agile development aims to break down the silos between requirements analysis, testing, and development. The DevOps movement is aimed at removing these silos, encouraging continuous improvement at all levels, and leveraging automation to work smarter, not harder.

Essential aspects of DevOps:

- Continuous improvement
- Continuous delivery
- Testing automation
- Infrastructure automation
- Integrate security earlier into the development process

**Continuous Improvement**
Steps to experiencing continuous improvement:

- Recognize that continuous improvement and failure go hand in hand.
- Share knowledge from individuals and teams via methods such as Lunch ‘N Learn, Centers of Excellence, internal conferences, and other methods.
- Look for waste and opportunities to improve your processes. Streamlining and automation can go a long way.

**Continuous Delivery**
Continuous delivery reduces the risk of release and leads to more reliable and resilient systems. This is achieved through automation of the build, deploy, test, and release process.

Essential aspects of continuous delivery:

- Source control not only code but configuration management of infrastructure.
- Deploy code and servers almost completely automated.
- Every check-in, compile, test, and validate happens via continuous integration.

**Infrastructure as Code**
An essential part of continuous delivery is being able to manage infrastructure in an automated fashion.

**Shift-Left on Security**
Start with the following:

- Learn that security is everyone’s responsibility.
- Bring individuals of all abilities to a high level of proficiency in security in a short period of time.
- Know that the internal security team is not an adversary.
- Acknowledge that Developers build value for an organization; Security builds trust.

**Testing Automation**
The value of testing automation:

- Reduces errors in specifications and understanding.
- Mitigates risk by being able to repeat the tests on demand instead of scheduling resources to do that.
- Allows computers to perform repetitive tasks and lets people solve problems.

**Story Card Writing**
A Story Card is the unit of each deliverable for an agile team. Story cards include a sentence or two describing a needed function.

How to Write Story Cards:

- Cards are handwritten.
- Cards should follow the format: "As a [who], I want [what], so that [why].”
- Create Spike cards for experimental stories, mitigating your risk.
- Follow the INVEST rule for how to write a good user story.
- Use the 3 C's: the Card, Conversation, and Confirmation.
