### About

## Meet the Crew

We are agile consultants, coaches, and difference makers. Learn about who we are today, how we got here, and what makes us different.

**Who We Are**
Since LeanDog’s founding in 2008, we’ve found our purpose in building cultures and products that inspire and delight.

It all starts with our team. We are agile coaches, consultants, and engineers with the experience and passion to drive change. We believe in a better way to work.

We didn’t always lead agile transformations at Fortune 500 companies. We first started to help a startup in Wooster, Ohio; then became a small-scale tech incubator; then went on to build software for corporations on an as-needed basis. Each step led us to achieve what we do today.

We’ve now partnered with change agents at 200+ organizations, leading agile transformations at Fortune 100 companies, start-ups, and small businesses.

**Our Values: The Pillars of Our Culture**
- **We’re direct.** When it comes to your business, we say what we mean. We’re transparent and honest in all that we do.
- **We’re curious.** We’re always asking why—and why not. The more we learn, the more we realize we have yet to learn. It’s with that foundation that we’re bold and unafraid to challenge the norm.
- **We’re real people, and we have fun.** Building a culture means being real—honoring your truest self and those around you. Our team is down-to-earth, honest, and fun.
- **We’re drawn to the water.** It’s always in motion. It flows. Just like your business—the only constant is change itself. And, quite literally, our office is a boat.

**A Message from the Captain**
At LeanDog, we value people and teams over everything else. In fact, “people over process” is based on the first value of the Agile Manifesto. Internally, we’ve assembled a network of coaches second to none when it comes to enabling your team’s success.

When working with clients, we coach them on the importance of people. We identify the change agents who will empower the rest of the organization to live agile and adopt a better way to work. When all else fails, it’s the people who make the difference.

## Testimonials

**What Our Customers Are Saying About Us**

- "The overwhelming emotion is relief."  
  - Kathy Kennedy, Sr. Vice President, The Equity Engineering Group

- "I think the LeanDog team has opened my perspective of my responsibilities and has shown me the value of every member within an Agile team. Most of all, the simple reality that this process was designed to make product delivery 'fun'!"  
  - Carl Malony, Software Engineer, M&T Bank

- "If you want to explain to your company a better way to be organized, sustainable, strong during uncertainty, and have better communications within the company and with customers, call Jon Stahl and LeanDog to learn and implement an Agile environment."  
  - Sue Marrone, Owner, Mosaic Junction

- "Each exposure to LeanDog's material and coaching has led to more growth for me professionally. Jon Stahl and his team are constantly practicing what they preach, and their material continues to mature. From my first interaction a few years ago to now, I am still learning new nuances and perspectives thanks to the efforts of Jon and his team."  
  - John Koterba, BA/SM/PO, Dakota Software

- "I Needed Something to help me answer those big questions and that's absolutely what the Agile Explained session did for me."  
  - Eric Whitnable, Collaboration Consultant, Nationwide Insurance

- "As a business psychologist, I view 'Agile Explained' as an immersion learning technique. Get the basics covered, realize quickly you can do this with help, then it becomes a matter of practice to reap the benefits."  
  - Dr. Stacy Feiner, CEO and Founder, Psynamics

- "The Agile Explained Experience has been extremely effective."  
  - Mike Livermore, Sr. Manager, IT, Swagelok

- "We had several coaches from our organization in the same Agile Explained workshop. It has sparked some great conversations, new information for our teams, and some new experiments to try. These coaches are highly trained, educated and experienced...even with that, there were things to learn in this training. I'd recommend this training to all roles in the organization. It was a great overview of agile, but more specifically it was about the culture, outcomes, and possibilities that agile brings. Product Owners, project managers, and leadership are critical to be in attendance. While this training was held virtually with pre-recorded training segments, the coaches and leaders at LeanDog were available and answered questions in real-time in the chat and then addressed questions, concerns, and ideas 'live' after each segment. I highly recommend it!"  
  - Beverly Sunkle, Sr. IT Manager, Ambercrombie and Fitch

- "There is a reason LeanDog is where they are and why they affect so much change with a lot of companies."  
  - Justin Duane, CEO, RetailSource

- "I highly recommend this course! Jon and team do an incredible job providing a large amount of useful information in a short amount of time. They are knowledgeable, informative, and concise. I think all levels of Agile experience, in many career paths, will find this course beneficial."  
  - Terri Ramos, Project Lead, Cardinal Health

- "LeanDog helped us with a lean and agile methodology and taught us how to put up information in a big and visual way to help us collaborate and communicate."  
  - Jeff Curran, Ideation Coach, Cardinal Health

- "Jon Stahl and his LeanDog team are great facilitators and teachers, and know what they are about."  
  - Thomas Georgantis, Co-Owner/Managing Director, Effution

- "They clearly know there is value in employee happiness and they want to make every workplace and employee feel the same."  
  - Joan Fahrenkrug, Club Coordinator, Major League Baseball

- "It took us about 210 steps to get the patient through the system and into our scheduling department. We've cut that in half."  
  - Lisa Kristosik, Chief Operating Officer, VNA

- "The biggest Ah-Ha moment was how often all the different practices spoke about the people and allowing for a very open and collaborative thought process. Agile understand that having multiple people and roles on the project will give it the most well-rounded and holistic product that can be delivered at that time. We are all in a position to make our companies better, more efficient, and better aligned for today's competing markets. Using just a fraction of these ideas could help get you and your company there."  
  - Ilene Jarrell, Regional Manager, Fifth Third Bank

- "The Agile Explained course provides a well-rounded approach to various facets of Agile. It also offers tangible advice for how to guide and advance projects measurably."  
  - Kristen Jackson, Software Developer/Senior Technical Writer

- "It is obvious the LeanDog team is not only knowledgeable but passionate about Agile and helping people grow."  
  - Mark Kemmerling, IT Support Team Lead, Swagelok

- "I'm studying for my PMI-Agile certification and LeanDog was a great refresher course. All the key topics were covered and real examples were given for each class. It helped me in understanding that the key to Agile is a mindset, and to be successful, you just need to be willing to make change and think differently."  
  - Madalyn Gottschalk, Expert Systems Analyst, UPMC

- "We're using a lot of the tools and principles that we learned from LeanDog to really organize our thoughts to help us prioritize what we need to do over the next day, week, and even year."  
  - Rob Carlson, VP of Global Supply Chain, Dwellworks

- "Even if you believe you are 'Agile' this course could help you reflect on the core principles and perhaps, like me, identify important areas that have been compromised and eroded away in the day-to-day grind. This course allowed me to reflect and refocus on our commitment to constant improvement."  
  - Joe Sylvester, Product Owner, Vintri Technologies
