### The Three Flow Metrics (Plus One)
**by Kevin Sivic, on Apr 14, 2021**

Understanding team performance in agile environments involves three core metrics: Throughput, Work In Progress (WIP), and Cycle Time, defined by Little's Law.

**Throughput**  
The number of items completed in a given time period, indicating how many tasks are done, regardless of the reason.

**Work In Progress (WIP)**  
The number of items started but not completed. This includes everything currently in progress, including tasks on hold or waiting for dependencies.

**Cycle Time**  
The time from starting a task to its completion. It includes both active work and waiting periods.

**Work Item Age**  
This metric measures the elapsed time since a task was started. It helps predict the near-future performance of the workflow, highlighting items that may need attention due to prolonged progress.

Future posts will explore the use of these metrics to manage and improve workflows, and how they impact team predictability and customer value delivery.

### The #1 Mistake Most Companies Make In Their Digital Transformation
**by Julias Shaw, on Jun 25, 2020**

**Video Transcript**

Julias Shaw, CTO of LeanDog, shares a personal anecdote to highlight a common mistake in digital transformation: opting for off-the-shelf solutions instead of tailored approaches.

Julias recalls buying an expensive Armani suit, only to later find a custom-tailored suit in Hong Kong that fit much better at a fraction of the cost. The key lesson: customization based on specific needs and conditions often leads to better results than standardized solutions.

LeanDog applies this principle by starting every agile transformation with an Obeya workshop, a big visual room where the team collaboratively explores and tailors solutions specific to the organization's needs.

## DevOps Family Values & The Three Ways
**by Eric Hankinson, on Oct 23, 2018**

**Understanding Lead Time and Process Time**
In software development, it's crucial to distinguish between Process Time (PT) and Lead Time (LT). PT is the time taken to complete actual development work, while LT includes all time from the initial request to deployment, encompassing ideation, testing, and deployment preparation.

**Challenges with Deployment Lead Times**
Large organizations often face extended deployment lead times due to complex processes and minimal test environments, leading to extensive delays. This can result in poor customer outcomes and require significant effort from teams at all stages.

**Strategies for Improvement**
To streamline these processes, organizations should aim for:
- Fast, constant feedback
- Small, atomic code changes
- Automated testing
- Regular deployments

Shorter lead times increase confidence, reduce risks, and ensure faster feedback, enabling teams to make more frequent, smaller updates.

**Initial Metrics for DevOps**
To identify and address pain points in the DevOps journey, consider measuring:
- Lead Times: Total time from request to deployment
- Process Times: Time to complete development or fixes
- Percent Complete and Accurate: Quality of work items at each step

**The Three Ways in DevOps**
Outlined in "The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win," these principles guide successful DevOps practices:
1. **Flow:** Ensure a fast and smooth flow of work from development to operations to customers.
2. **Feedback:** Provide fast, continuous feedback at all stages to drive improvements.
3. **Continuous Learning & Experimentation:** Foster a culture of ongoing learning, sharing knowledge, and experimentation.
