So Alistair Coburn wrote the oath of non allegiance and race basically, it's just a statement explaining that we really need to open up our minds in many different ways of working and not be so judgmental of different practices. Respect the way that people are in the way different practices have come to be learn about that and then seek to uncover better ways. So a lot of people get very biased in our craft towards one way of doing things. So, hey, I'm a lean person. I'm a scrum person, extreme programming, Crystal. All these different ways. And really, the spirit of Agile is about respecting understanding all those different ways and seeking out your best way. So don't get too religious about one way. experiment, try, adapt, learn, and support. Anybody who's trying to improve our craft and discover better ways of building and delivering software.
