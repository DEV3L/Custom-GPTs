We have found that traditional manual testing is way too expensive when agile teams in our first sprint will produce some software. And if we test it manually, it'll take one testing unit to test that piece of software. In a second sprint, by its definition, it will take more, we'll have to test the things that we wrote in the first sprint plus the new things that we've added. And over time, that amount of testing continues to grow. And manual testing is not a sustainable way to test the application from that perspective, the amount of effort grows and grows and grows. And because it's manual, and we're following the script, it's actually error prone and it's not reproducible. We're human, we make mistakes along the way, we found that it's essential to automate our functional tests on agile teams, see only a way that we can continuously test all of the application and continuously produce a higher quality. One thing that automating the functional test does for us is it frees up the testers to perform exploratory testing, which is where we really leverage their testing skills and their knowledge of the application. exploratory testing is the goal. Automated functional testing is one of the tools that helps us achieve that goal.
