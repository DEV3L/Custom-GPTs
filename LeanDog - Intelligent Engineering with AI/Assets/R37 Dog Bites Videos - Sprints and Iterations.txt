So agile people practice the Agile you'll hear the term sprints and iterations on the really the same thing. If we're studying Scrum, they're called sprints. If you're doing something else is usually called iterations. The whole point of sprints and iterations is we timebox our work. If we don't time box, our working can go on forever. So we do is we say, hey, let's actually work in two weeks sprints, or one week sprints. Scrum, initially recommended 30 day, but most of the industry, I'd say over 90% of it is gone at least two weeks sprint, some companies, smaller companies, product companies tend to go down to one week sprints. So the whole one of the key concepts of Agile is inspect and adapt. And so we have to set a timeframe in which we inspect and adapt to everything. So the goal is we open up an iteration or sprint, we do the work that we said we were going to do the promise we try to deliver business value. At the end of the sprint, we're going to do a show and tell retrospective, review the work that we've demonstrated to our customer, and then start the next week. So we need to self examine and inspect and adapt often. So if you set your sprints too long, and you find out 30 days that you're building the wrong thing, or you didn't, you aren't making progress because you have barriers or blocks. That's too much time to go by and inspect and adapt. So we prefer lean docks shorter iterations, two weeks or less. And you know, even in a more of a kanban style if you want to look at a different alternative that makes you see the whole system and kind of get rid of the notions of sprints and iterations and really focus on flow theory of constraints but Sprint's and iterations if you're doing Scrum, keep them short. And make sure that you're following the inspect and adapt processes at the end like show and tell retrospective, etc.
