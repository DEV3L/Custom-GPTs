Often a team is not sure exactly how to solve a problem. And as a result, they can't really estimate a story. And what we do is we use a technique called spikes. For those situations, a spike is nothing more than a time box Research or r&d effort to try to understand what's the best solution for solving a problem. If we want to evaluate technologies, we would do that in the spike. And these are typically measured in a few hours up to a day or so. If you find that you're going to need to spend a week on something then there's probably way too much uncertainty to introduce into the team at that time, and we need to get more information about it before we even do a spike. At the end of a spike. I typically like to have the person who performs a spike report back to the team, what they discovered and what they think what direction they believe we should go, but have the whole team discuss that and make the decision together. A spike is nothing more than a time boxed effort to understand something better to bring information back to the team so that the team can make a decision
