The show entails usually occur at the end of every iteration, or sprint. If you're doing Scrum, the purpose of a show and tell is to get everybody in the room, the entire team. And actually kind of demo, what you've built for the customers in a way is kind of a mini user acceptance testing, it's very important to have the customer in the room. It's really cool for the developers, everybody involved in the team to get the satisfaction of seeing the customer react to their product and accept the product, or critique the product or add another card about it. It's a positive reinforcement that was customer you're working hard that they actually are appreciating the software and that you've built the software. Well, I typically like to have the developers drive it the demo of each of their story cards that they completed during the show until the reason for that is usually the business analysts or product owners and, and QA they've touched it enough and that they're all developers really get a chance to actually demo the product. So it gives them a chance to get up in front of the room showcase kind of what they've coded and built and or even have the designers do it but Show and Tell is a very key important part of making sure that you feel like you've done good work, and that you're building what the customer wants.
