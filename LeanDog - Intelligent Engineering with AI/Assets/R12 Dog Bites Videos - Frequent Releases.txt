As we're building software, we make a lot of assumptions there product owners, assuming that we're building the right thing. And they're making some assumptions around, what are the highest value things we can deliver. The team is making assumptions around the usability and user interface of the system as well. The only way we know for sure if those assumptions are right is trying to get the software into the hands of the end users. Not only does getting the software in the hands of the end users help us validate those assumptions. But it helps us discover the new things that we're going to work on. Often we can deliver software to customers or to our client, or to the end users. And they'll start to use it and they'll say, you know, this was this was nice, but it would surely be more helpful if it did this other thing as well, or this other thing would be more important to us. That helps us make sure that we're focused on the right thing. The only way we can achieve this is by releasing the code. Frequently frequent releases is one of the principles of the Agile Manifesto. And we find that it's the central technique in order for us to get the feedback from the end users to make sure that we're building the right thing and to make sure we're heading in the right direction as we develop software.
