So servant leadership, what is leadership?

Servant leadership is where your main goal isn't to make people do what you want, but to get out of their way, or to get other things out of the way so they can do the job. So

as a participant of way of management where we empower the the group makes decisions together. So it's not about managing be autocratic, telling you what to do, right? It's like how do we actually get the team to build consensus and to do the right thing, as an organization? So it's one of the hardest things when people go Agile, is we tend to sometimes say, Well, we're going to take our best project manager who might be autocratic, or Command Control. And we said, well, you're going to lead this team, when really what we want you to do is pick your best leader, like somebody who enjoys seeing the team come to decisions, and making mistakes together, right? That's kind of what it's about like to be on the agile team. So if you don't have the right person with the right attitude and aptitude to be a leader, and listen to the team and be okay with them making the decisions with you, you're probably gonna have a hard time with your agile movement. That's really

important. The part about making mistakes, yeah, you got to be able to encourage people to make mistakes and learn from them. If you're all command and control and yelling at people when they make mistakes, that's not gonna happen. So there's like no point in hiring people who are smarter than you if you're not gonna let them do their job.

Exactly. So anyway, study it, there's great books on it. and challenge yourself to see if you can actually be a true servant leader your team and support them, remove roadblocks and help them get what they need to do to execute
