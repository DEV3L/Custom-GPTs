I can't have been exposed to Agile for very long without having heard about the Agile Manifesto. Most people who practice agile are aware of it. Many habits memorized and know each of the four values at least, but not necessarily all 12 principles. The agile manifesto was written in Snowbird, Utah in 2001, by a group of 17 individuals that got together sharing ideas about lightweight methodologies for software development. This was a response to the increasing structure and restrictions around the way that software is being developed in those days, a lot of heavy documentation, a lot of handoffs and siloing. And what these folks found was that by working together in small teams and delivering frequently, they were producing higher quality software and meeting their customers needs better than using the more commonly known techniques. So we got together share their ideas, shared their thoughts, and out of that distill down four values and 12 common principles that are basically the guiding factors for Agile software development. So the four Agile values are pretty commonly known individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software, over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation and responding to change over following the plan. These four values can guide the behaviors of teams that are practicing agile, in addition to those values. There are 12 principles that support them that are more an explanation of the why behind those guys.
