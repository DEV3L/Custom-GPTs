**Time to Get Unstuck.**
The team is spread too thin—you answer to several stakeholders, have various priorities, and don’t have the capacity to deliver on deadlines. Your team is just one of a few or hundreds across the organization. The problem is not unique.

Many organizations are made up of disparate, siloed teams, each with its own goals. The result: deadlines get pushed back, costs rise, and outcomes don’t match expectations. When customer needs go unfulfilled, competitors move in to fill the gaps.

Organizations come to us when they know they need change.

We drive that change through agile practices and methods. By optimizing for business agility, organizations of all sizes and industries can:

- **Manage Capacity:** Maximize value delivery with limited resources.
- **Drive Velocity:** Move faster by limiting waste.
- **Improve Quality:** Reduce defects and improve customer experience.

**Real-life Agile**
Hear how one company implemented agile to tackle its biggest issues, creating:

- A clear focus on priorities and goals.
- More productive meetings—saving hours at a time.
- Greater adaptability to change.

**What is Agile?**
By definition, something agile is “able to move quickly and easily.” The agile approach empowers self-organizing teams to deliver more value to customers in less time. This is a fundamental shift from the hierarchical command-and-control structures that have dominated organizational designs of the past. Instead, we believe in protecting teams from outside interference and removing roadblocks that impede delivery, business value, and productivity.

**Agile is the mindset that builds environments for teams and people to thrive.**

**What does it mean to “be agile?”**
Agile is not a process; it’s a set of values and principles. The goal of an agile transformation is to create a culture that upholds these values and principles. It's not about implementing one practice (such as Kanban or Scrum) and declaring yourself agile. It’s about continually seeking better ways to achieve organizational goals.

Agile teams focus on the most important projects, can effectively set expectations with stakeholders, adjust on the fly, and deliver the highest quality results.

**What Makes Agile the Better Way to Work?**
Our business is built on agile. Agile organizations recognize several benefits, but what sets it apart from other methodologies and approaches?

1. **Agile isn’t limited.**
   Agile is a set of values and principles, not a process. Unlike the mechanisms used to implement the agile methodology—such as DevOps, scrum, Kanban, and others (which we are well-versed in and huge fans of)—agile applies to any organization that wants to improve. Software companies, financial institutions, manufacturers, non-profit organizations, and others can reinvent their culture with agile to improve productivity, profitability, and performance.

2. **Agile is adaptable.**
   In 2018, 75% of Fortune 500 companies were new from 30 years earlier. What does that mean? Complacency kills. Agile companies embody the concept of continuous improvement. They are able to adapt to new and improved ways of working on the fly.

3. **Agile promotes transparency.**
   Agile companies get everything out in the open—tools like information radiators, story card walls, and a daily standup keep all collaborators on the same page. Visual elements and team dynamics further emphasize transparent communication.

4. **Agile engages stakeholders.**
   Agile cultures are designed to improve stakeholder communications. Increased transparency creates stakeholder visibility and enables alignment between our work and key organizational objectives.

5. **Agile empowers teams.**
   We believe in flat organizations comprised of many productive, high-performing teams. The “whole team” approach is the glue of agile. It states that everyone is accountable for the quality of the product, bringing entire teams together to collaborate and share responsibility throughout the delivery lifecycle.

6. **Agile improves quality.**
   When a team shares responsibility for the results of its work and operates transparently throughout, issues are identified and corrected in real-time—not at a project’s conclusion. We show agile software teams how to leverage automated testing practices to create defect-free software, enabling more focus on real value. Agile teams across the enterprise can apply the same fundamentals in their work to limit rework and improve customer experience.
