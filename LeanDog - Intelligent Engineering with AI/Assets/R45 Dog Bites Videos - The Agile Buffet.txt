So we call this list here, the Agile buffet. The reason we call it a phase is kind of analogous to a food buffet. When you go to a food buffet, you don't eat the entire buffet, you pick and choose which things you want based on what your appetite is or what problem you're trying to solve your film, and how you feel. So we call it a buffet for that reason not to say that you need to do all of these practices. We've organised this buffet in a particular way, we have concepts and processes. We those are practices that we believe everybody involved in Agile, should at least have a basic understanding of including your business partners and customers. The other areas of the buffet, the quarters, the buffet, if you will, are based on your craft. So some of them are duplicated. So for example, we'll cover a lot of basic concepts down the center, but then we have the scrum master iteration management facilitator. They're the person who's responsible for upholding some of those practices. So there's some structure to it. But again, there's many ways to accomplish things. This is just our way of kind of depicting all the things that we cover in a book. It's kind of our outline of what we have in our discussion guide. There's lots more to the discussion guide besides the buffet. But these are the core practices that we're currently practicing and teaching
