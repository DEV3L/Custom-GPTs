value stream maps are a type of flowchart. design that's used to help us see a process from beginning to end. So a product from the moment that customer requests it all the way through to the moment that the customer actually receives it. Value stream mapping can be used in software in a couple of different ways. One common use, you'll see is will actually map out the business needs itself. So a customer has a need, what are we as a business doing to satisfy that need? And how do we get that product to the customers, we actually map that out and look for opportunities there, to drive out ways to increase efficiency, and perhaps to leverage technologies to make the process better. This can also better inform us of how the business works, so that we can better write software to enable the business. Another way that value stream mapping can be used in software development is for us to actually map our own software development process. So from the moment that a feature hits the team, all the way through to the moment that feature actually makes it to production, what are all the varying steps, what are all the varying gates, and who are all the possible contingencies that are involved, so we can see the entire process, consider it, look for opportunities to drive out wastes to move things to the front, move things to the back and just increase efficiencies, and reduce our cycle time increase our ability to deliver value to the customer faster. So Value Stream Mapping again, a simple tool for just mapping out a process from request to delivery can be used to evaluate the business and better educate us on how we can apply software to help the business can also be used to actually look at the process that we use to deliver software and help us to improve our own inner workings on our teams.
