#### We'll Help You Build the Culture and Products to Support It.

At LeanDog, weâ€™ve been helping organizations implement and scale agile practices for over 15 years. Every organization is unique, starting from different points with its own culture, challenges, and goals. Our process begins with an assessment of where your organization is today, where you want to go, and how to get there.

We follow a proven six-step process for implementing agile in your company:

1. **Assemble Your Crew:** We gather change agents from all levels of your organization, including executives, project/product managers, and delivery teams. Change agents are individuals passionate about continual improvement and exhibiting skills like courage, communication, feedback, and respect.

2. **Equip and Train:** We train your crew in essential skills, including lean agile, design thinking, DevOps, and servant leadership. The team completes a LeanDog-led Agile Explained course, establishing a baseline of agile methodologies and terminology.

3. **Understand Your World:** Using the Obeya method (a Japanese term meaning "big visual room"), we create a physical or digital representation of your current state. This visual tool ensures everyone is on the same page and helps uncover overlooked issues.

4. **Design Your Organization:** We map out your demand funnel and technology assets, identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement. This step often reveals a need for reorganization to support high-performing teams aligned with agile principles.

5. **Chart Your Course:** We develop a personalized transformation plan, emphasizing agile methodologies, servant leadership, adaptive processes, continuous improvement, and transparency.

6. **Adjust Your Sails:** Agile transformation is a journey of continuous improvement. We help you adjust as you make cultural and structural changes, ensuring sustainable growth and scaling over time.
