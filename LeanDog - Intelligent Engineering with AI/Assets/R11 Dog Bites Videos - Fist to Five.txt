So another technique that we like to practice in Lean dog around decision making, it was what we call fist to five, I'm not sure where it originated was pretty common in the Agile community. We're trying to make a decision on something, we pretty much take your hand and we kind of do paper, scissors rock, and we do we throw it, we throw a number out a five means I completely agree with it, and I'm full for it. And we should do this. A one means or fist means I'm going to actively work against it. Okay, a three kind of means, you know what, I'm in the middle. I don't I have an opinion, but I'll go with whatever the team decides. So often, if we're talking about something, and we just want to get to consensus, we say hey, tell you what fist to 5123 We throw our hands out, right? We look for the consensus. If there's a lot of dissent, right? There's a lot of variation between you know, fully supportive verse down into ones and twos and even a fist. We better stop and talk about it and do something about it. Typically, if we do a fist of five and like wow, okay, we're have a pretty big degree of separation here. The next technique that we usually employ is six thinking hats by Edward de Bono, so check out our other page or book our guide for more information about that, but easy practice works. You'll see a lot of agile teams do it even some end up even use it for their planning poker as well. They just said on the card flop. They actually do the hands simple geason and borders
