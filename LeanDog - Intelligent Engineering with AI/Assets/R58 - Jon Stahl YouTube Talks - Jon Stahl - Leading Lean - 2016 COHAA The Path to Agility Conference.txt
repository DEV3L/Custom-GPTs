Alright, let's get started. So, Greg bet me I couldn't do this whole conference talk in a full face helmet. So it's worth a beer. So you're gonna have to suffer through it. So they're actually this is a Rick Mears helmet for time IndyCar champion, so I got to borrow it, so they take care of it. So thanks for coming to the talk a little bit about me. So I actually, I'm from Pittsburgh, I went to Ohio State computer science econ degree. I worked up in Cleveland for years. I live in Cleveland now. And I spent the first few years of their building agile teams eventually started getting them all my friends down here in Columbus nationwide, was asked to kind of work with Srini Shireen here to help lead the transformation nationwide. And I spent the last eight years making a career out of it and starting lean. So we've written a book, remote, we're in a book, you can download our agile discussion guide, there's about 60 different practices we teach. So for us, it's not just about Scrum, it's not just about Lean, it's about psychology, sociology, creating high performing organizations, anything we can do to improve flow and improve the team. So feel free to download, it's free. And it's more of a discussion point, all the talking points when we talk about all these different topics, what we cover what we do at lean dawg, we do this, we help companies go Agile and Lean. And then we also have a design build studio. So we are designed to build products up in Cleveland, on our boat. This is talking we talk to you about today is not about how to build high performing software teams. It's how to build a high performing lean organization. So if you're here to hear about, you have your management software team, you want to make them better. This is different. This is more about how you take a bunch of leaders that are on a mission and how to adopt Lean thinking to go faster. And so the topic is this talk is kind of speeding lean, one of the things we do to try to improve a high performing organization at the leadership team level, okay? We'll start off here by watching.

Okay, so buy Rolex. Actually, so the point of that video is that, you know, when you think about speed and lean, it's easier to understand Lean thinking, when it comes by the physical things, right. So whether it's manufacturing, whether you're managing inventory, you can see ways you can see flow, and you can kind of understand where the handoffs are happening, and where the delay, and where even the over commitment over processing all the forms of waste. So our challenge is, how do we actually apply and lean into running a high performing organization, not running the necessary software teams, but again, running, running high performing teams, so I'm not going to preach you guys the principles of Lean, there's enough lean books out there. But these are the principles and then there's the forms of waste. So this talks structured in three parts. First, we're gonna talk about how do we create people systems? Okay, how do we create a continuous improvement environment? And how do we continually improve our standard of work? And how do we do that in the world, it's not physical at all. And you can't see, you know, Jack on a car, and you can't see the inventory. So you have to really talk, how do you manage flow? And how do you manage improving your organization? So let's first talk about the left point there, the high performing teams. So the first key to me is creating a environment. We work for a lot of corporations, we help a lot of corporate cultures try to do this thing. When I started lean dog. Eight years ago, I could do anything I wanted, because I was a startup with no money. And so I could just build whatever I felt like building. So one things I learned when I was here, and I was working at nationwide and we work with people in innovation is you have to think big. So the bigger you can stretch people's minds. They're going to come back to someone who's comfortable. So don't set a goal that you want him to get to. So one way beyond and stretch them to it. So we're looking for Office. We found it at 92 steamship. Okay. So 22 years older than Titanic. As soon as you walk in this boat, you're like this is pretty risky. First of all, because it's old. But second of all, it's it's big and it's been refactored it used to be a restaurant. So it's 10,000 square foot and it was sitting there abandoned for two years and starting a company a down economy, things were cheaper. So I said, Hey, how about I move in and taste the rats off? Turn the lights on? And maybe, maybe, eventually, we can buy it and we did. So what's cool about this again, as soon as people walk on are like, Okay, you mean you have a boat floating like eerie the freezes in the ice in the winter? Like that's pretty weird. And, and so we just want them to think okay, yeah, you can do anything if you open up your mind to you can just go as big as wild as you want. So if you're a Cleveland, come see us there's I'll give you free parking for the Rock Hall, science, Senator browns, wherever you wanna do a lot. I'll just show you around. So the first part about creating your space was letting your team design your space. A lot of people call us up and they say, can you come in and help us to create this open, agile environment? And we could, you know, the leaders, we could certainly do that we can take a budget, and we can buy, we can go furniture, shopping, and pick out all the cool tables, and all the cool things. But ultimately, we're trying to do is hire creative people, creative people that are makers, creative people like to build things, creative. People like to solve things. So almost every creative person I know, and probably everybody in this room has a passion or hobby. There's something about them that ticks right. So in this room, this is the front of our boat. We painted a kraken on the walls. Why? Because I have four really awesome user centered design people, and I can't draw a damn thing. And they can't. And I said, Why don't you guys design something that makes a space in the front of the room? Kind of so you know, I don't know about a cracking because that's kind of like a launch to the grabs a ship and sinks it but I went with it, right? Because it doesn't matter. Because every time I look at that wall, I think about Nicole and I think about Apollo and I think about will and those are the designers that got together and they they now own it. So when somebody comes to their house, they're showing off their work. They're saying, Yeah, we actually painted that we did that, and our leader support and doing that. So if you come to the boat, you'll see stuff everywhere. Somebody gave us an old boat. We had people that were craftsmen and woodworking. We say hey, what can we do with this little boat? Let's turn it into a table. Let's refactor it, reuse it now as part of Bill, Bill Bill refactor that. It took how long Greg months and months and months, but it doesn't matter. Right? Bill did it. And even just last week, he's retired, he still walks in, he shows off that boat, right. And he helped create that he helped build perfect environment. So let your people build. We came across a crazy guitar, because we got the rock on these guitars up there and somebody so I got this car and have no idea how it fits in with the boat, boat theme, but we wanted it so we hanging upside down right? So we like looking at weird things. Things that provoke thought things that make you think outside of the box. So let your people that give him a budget, trust him. They're adults, they can design their own house, they can certainly design our work environment, right? Let them change it up, let them be creative. Let them show off their space. Right? feeling comfortable at your second home is just as important as feeling comfortable with home, right? Let these people show off and let them do it. So I hate it when people give us a budget and say we're just gonna, we're gonna make all the decisions for the team and dammit, they better like our open workspace. Right? It doesn't make sense. They're adults treat them like adults. Okay, give them some budget and let him go. Clearly, we were all about the open workspaces and collaboration, we have it everywhere. We have no offices, all over leadership to open the second floor of the boats where he managed lean dog, I'll show you a bit more about how we do that in a minute. The other thing we value is T shaped people. So we really value diversity. And when I say diversity, I believe going Agile and Lean is kind of like going to it's like when you go back to Agile lean, you're going back to adult kindergarten, right? We all sit in an open workspace, we put our homework up on the wall. Everybody knows who the better reader is. Right? We have show Intel's we show up to work on time we leave on time. Right? We have recess, okay? And we have this continual learning culture. When I was in kindergarten, I didn't know what Trini wanted to be, or Greg wanted to be or anybody else. We're just all there to learn, right? We just created that environment. So one of the best things we do at lean dog. Since we're passionate on building things, we didn't hire just computer science engineers, we hired mechanical and electrical engineers. Why? Because it's all engineering. They're all makers, right? And just gives us that diversity to learn, hey, just because I got a degree from Ohio State and computer science doesn't mean I only want to write code, I'd love to be able to design things and make them useful and usable. I'd also like to learn a lot about electrical and mechanical, right as well, because now I can see software design, make physical design. And now this world of IoT is taken off. And so it was kind of unleashed just on raw talent that we didn't even know we had because we create things for makers. The other thing we don't like to see in the workspace is games, okay? Most of us can afford a Sony a Wii or whatever video game we want. We buy 3d printers, we buy laser printers, we buy Lay's, we buy sauce, right, we buy things that let people create. So when I'm not coding, I'm not solving that problem. Maybe I can go to learn another craft and somebody else in the room and learn how to do something else. So we we bought the first couple 3d printers because they were fun. And now everybody's making with them. And we solve problems every day. I think we had a part on the doorknob go the other day and somebody say up, print that and fix it right. So you never know that from facilities to producing products for our customers, giving people access to things that make with beyond the sciences, right gives them a continual learning path that they normally wouldn't get up outside of your work. So 3d printers are 2500 bucks, buy one usually takes a team of 10 people to keep them around anyways. So it's there's a continual learning curve there but you'll be surprised at the pride they take and, and knowing that by getting 3d printers in our space, we then started running maker nights and now we give back to kids. So we have we teach kids how to do programmable Valentine led book Valentine's gift cards. We do sumo bot wrestling we took a teddy bear we cut a hole in the back of the chip in it, put a gear in its arm run Android app, the tweet at it the way the kids. So now we're actually giving back to the community by teaching how do we combine three engineering disciplines Plus user centered design, right? And so those are skills that I'd never expect Actually certainly in dog that our people would take a passion and do it just because we gave them great maker type stuff. So adult recess we encourage it but it's adult. We have a fitness center over at the airport next door where we're docked. We have a whole bunch of schedules from yoga time to bike riding a cycling that running. We have kickball league summer leagues, we have kayaking leagues. Two years ago, we actually had summer interns that would take our fishing boat, and they would clean the boat in the morning. We take clients out in the morning fishing, they fillet the fish for lunch, and then we serve lunch for customers. So we encourage people to get out and have fun. We treat them like adults. We give them toys. We never had an issue. We don't have waivers. Yeah, don't tell my insurance company. But we don't because we hire responsible people, people that we can trust and we trust them. Right. And we've never had an issue because people don't abuse it. You surround yourself by highly talented people. You really don't have these issues. It's a culture it's a community. People don't abuse. kayaks, paddle boards we provide healthy lunches for people.

In the winter, we even have an ice rink glatt not this year because it was too warm. But last year it froze and we made an ice rink we pump the water up we made a home Boney Zamboni thing and we clean the ice we have ice fishing tents with little gas fire pits in them and we go out we write code and and ice fishing tents. So we expand out onto the ice. We are right next to a world war two submarine here and the Coast Guard's right here. So it's pretty every time they want to do a news article on us like, should you really go out on Lake Erie ice we we watch the Coast Guard train for hours and hours and hours and cold water rescue right next to us. So we feel pretty comfortable. But but they they sometimes don't they can sometimes come over and they get worried too. So. So as I mentioned the key dog kindergarten creating a great high performing team as we hire trustworthy people, and we trust them. Okay, I think most of the waste that we see we go into companies because of trust. Right? We have papers, we have gates, we have signatures, we have sign off with handoffs, why because our trust was violated once and I never want to get burned again. So I'm gonna put rules in place. Every rule slows down the system. Okay, so we like to start with no rules, since you only add a rule if you absolutely need to add a rule, okay. And you can't do that if your culture doesn't believe in this. Okay, if I have a trust issue with something, I have to have the courage to bring it up and talk about it. Right? I can't say Oh, yeah. You know what? I don't want to confront Greg. So we're just gonna write a rule. So Greg, yeah. Because that Greg did that one thing. Maybe Greg didn't even realize he did it. But I have to have the courage, communication, feedback and respect to say, hey, we don't want you don't want us to create the Greg rule to you, right. And so we basically talked about that, let's not let it happen. Again, let's make sure we don't have it. But let's not penalize the whole flow of the system. And our whole trust factor, because one person, so yeah, we have a full bar. We we did retrospectives on our work environment all the time, the only rule we had around our bar, which is not the one that people think is if you have a drink, you have to ring a bell. And why because in a retrospective if you had a drink, and you didn't tell everybody else who was rude, right. And so it was a rude rude to spill. And we even have a rule on the bell here that if you actually don't ring the bell, first you have to bring in a fruit tray for the entire team. And that was to balance out the drinking factor. We felt we bring something unhealthy. And so again, we've never had an issue, we run six or eight meetups a week at a boat with the public still never had an issue with the Lean loggers. There were patrols were watching the boat and were there. People don't abuse it, you know, we move them out of there we do or where you have to do. And it's just it really isn't hard because we're all adults. And we just operate that way. So this is the 3d printing I was telling you about. Yeah, we used this 3d printer to make that 3d printer. Right now we're doing plasma cutters, and we got all kinds of toys and it looks like chaos. But it's like geek chaos, right? There's like stuff everywhere parts, supplies, electrical stuff. You never know what they're going to create next. That other day, I was walking by the refrigerator in the kitchen and I got squirted with water from the fridge. Because they actually figured out how to hack the fridge and make the fridge smart. Right? So they could actually say Amazon echo command support the fridge and all of a sudden in the kitchen, the water would squirt out of the fridge. So it creates this fun environment like what's the challenge? What can we what can we use technology to automate everything in your environment, they try to automate. And then you find out about all these latent skills, which is another form of waste, right? And we can now uncover those latent skills. Now we can leverage them. So amplify learning. So we host a lot of events we bring it in, this is the making the lake this is for kids, we do this twice a month. These ones the Ruby, the Java, the Python, lean, they're even on here. We host a lot of meetings, we pay a lot of money to host those meetings, because I want to bring learning to the people. So we're there on their break. If they're learning by hacking on something, or they're attending one of these events after work. It's just it's just really easy to do and it gives us a sense of pride in the community that we're giving back to community and teaching. A part of our core values giving back we've been Cleveland give camp seven years in a row. We've helped 20 over 20 charities here for seven years. Um, we host concerts and events on the boat. Why? Because again, a lot of people in it are skilled craftsmen. Either they, they're into music, they're into woodworking, they're into cars, or into making something else besides us solving software problems. And so, because of that, you know, a lot of we're in the music. So we have, we had requests for pop up concerts to happen on the boat. And now we have social time. So if we want to hang out after the work and do something social, with no pressures, no tie to technology at all, we just hang out for music. We also get used to having Music Mondays, where we just invite all the geeks in town, regardless just to come and jam on the boat and play. In the summer, we do outdoor concerts on the boat. So I don't know how your environments look. But stretch your mind, try to think big try to do extreme things, trust people tell people you're gonna put rules in unless, unless we broke break trust, like 10 times. And usually it's not, it's gonna be one or two people that just don't get it. So you have to have the courage as a leader to say, Hey, listen, we don't want to our first resistant is not to put a rule in place. That's our first course of action or second course of action, or third, we're putting rules against it. There's no other way we can operate. And then you really have to look at the people system first. Any questions about that? I talk fast. So. Not too quiet. Too dark. Okay. All right. Now let's talk about standard work. So how many people are familiar with the term see the hole in Lean? Right? So this is a two. So we're talking about that. We're talking about how do we see the whole system and that's the hardest thing to lead a team is I hire everybody on my team to manage something, they all have a certain scope of responsibilities, they all have something to watch, they have some system, some standard to keep an eye on whether it's finance, legal, HR sales, you know, software delivery, whatever it is, they all have a certain span of control. And because I'm hiring leaders, they can all create infinite amounts of work, right? So typically, when we go in any organization, you have various degrees of understanding this system. If you've been there 10 years, you probably understand a lot better how things work, how does finance work? How's legal legal work? How's HR, you know, what are the standards for how we actually work in our culture? The problem is, is that it's really easy for us to think that we just agree on this, like we know what the state is. So we often just head nod, right? Yeah, so I'm glad we all agree. But soon as we start making things physical, okay, and put them up on the board and making paper, we can see the differences. And now that we have an explicit model, we can converge right. So this is information radiators, Alastair Coburn from Crystal, right, but it works in lean to, right, it's part of the the key concept of lean and Kanban is make your work visual, so you can understand it. So once we once we now to get there, and now we can create a shared understanding. So this is probably we go crazy on this anybody's ever worked with Lean dog, and we help them to get we go crazy with information radiators, because we just see that they work. Even if you're off by a little bit, whatever countermeasure or option you want to play next to get better as a team can be different if you're just a hair off. So whether it's Microsoft executives, or screenies, or Dave's, or whomever, if we don't, if we aren't exactly on the same page, we can all agree the next thing can do could be just slightly different. That's waste. Okay, because we can see the picture perfectly clear, then we could probably because we're probably all pretty smart people. That's probably how we got to where we were at, we could probably then better off agree on what the best course of action is in reduce waste. So let me show you how this works. Yes, we do have a couple of technology radiators. These are burndown charts and things like that. So in our studio, because we have many customers that we're building for, and they're remote, we do have TVs, but for the most part, that's probably the only digital thing you'll see on the boat. As far as information, radio, everything else we do is physical. These are our team norms. So our team wrote these Apalis is in the other room here with another speaker. And this is this is what the team agreed to right. Everybody agreed that this is a really big deal. It's a really big deal that we're on the same page so we can make a separate action. So anytime we start to go away from using information radiators, we kind of ask ourselves, what are we going to do to uphold our values until this needs to change? It doesn't change. It will do retrospectives. We'll change it if we need to. But the team wrote this I didn't ask him to do it. We talked about the value information Raiders, I actually brought in my own outside lien coach because it's just like why we work to get an outside person to say what your work so we did that. And that when they finally got it. They're like okay, we all get why lean systems work, and why information radiators are a big deal. It's kind of the start of everything when you're going lean. So if you come to the boat, you'll see this is our marketing and well got things up here like how we we don't market very well we just speak at conferences. So we're trying to learn how to do this. After seven years, we're trying to say how do we enter a market? So you have different ways we market you have conversion rates, you have some metrics. This is our speaking conference calendar because that's what we mostly do. But now we have a better rate here on how much how much speaking are we doing versus how much are we doing any online marketing, we're just starting to under under understand this space, it was something we just didn't. I always say we were geeks without a marketing plan, we had no plan, right, we just share what we know. And we hope we wouldn't work. We have a finance wall, become the boat, you can see how much money we have in a bank account. You can see how much each customer that we work for owes us, which is really convenient when they're happy hour and a owe you money.

And you kind of calves in school have a beer over here. And it's check out this wall. But we don't work cash business. If we don't if we don't bring in cash. We don't we have beer mugs here indicating how well we're doing. We're performance. If you want to spend something, you write it on a post it note, you stick it on the spending wall, anybody in the company, we don't have budgets, okay, we're adults. Okay? We all know that upstairs, we each have a different different responsibility. Somebody better make sure we have business to like customer delight and people delight. So if you want to spend money you put up on the wall, hey, I wanted to buy this. After our stand up usually, once a week, we say hey, we're having a spending meeting. And we have three stand ups at the boat, one for the leadership team, one for the boat. And then there's another Studio One. And so basically, we announced during that stand up, hey, today's spending day. So if you want to spend money, you come up and you stand in front of two or three of us leadership team. And you state your case, here's what I want to spend money for. Here's what I want to do it like okay, well, let's check out how are the financials looking, and then you can't see it. But our goals are over here. Like kind of what we're chasing. So we're like, good, does that line up to our goals? You know, does that make sense? And we just talked about it. Often the person, we have to go back and do a bit more research or digging, and we have to understand it better. But it's just this transparency moment to say, giving out money and spending money are the two most political things you do. Right? It's the most complicated thing you do, because money affects everybody. So denying somebody money, or not giving somebody compensation and rewards are very sensitive topics. So we want to make that as transparent as we can. Because it's really a complicated problem for us to solve. And they think the person at the top just can see everything. Like I can't just see the whole system and know where they actually approve your spending requests or years or years or how many stacking up. It's just not that simple. So by saying we often want by just saying the notion, Hey, today is spending meeting, we're gonna have one Thursday after standups. There's also three more people who all have something that want to spend money on. And so they'll bring it up rather than wait. So now we can look at the whole system. It's okay, I thought just you know, I thought just Greg was asking for money, but there's actually eight of you. Okay, that's different. We need to talk about that. And when you talk about the highest value spin, so again, hard to do. More finance, wall stuff. Sales wall, this, oops, that's our sales funnel. So our sales funnel? Yeah, we put it in a tool called pipe drive. But we still make it physical, while we make it visible, because we want to measure Wait, I want to know, you know, how long do I give somebody a statement of work to how long did they sign it we tied up in the MSA process legal process? Because getting things through our system is not everybody's job. It's like what can I do to help you get sales through the funnel? If it's blocked, if there's a blocker there, maybe there's something I can do to help you. Or last issue that was MSA is we have somebody new, known legal and we're really over analyzing MSA is to the nth degree. And finally, why don't we just hire somebody that has some legal background and understands risk, legal risk better than we understand software risk? So we finally realized that they were having a huge delays. And for a really small fee, we could actually really believe aid that constraint we're losing deals because we couldn't meet our customers needs because somebody was new with the legal process, it was one little step. But you could spend eight hours going to contract or 30 minutes, right? It's really up to you. And so based on the engagement, we've sized, how much risk do we want to absorb? Right? If a small quick engagement, maybe we don't analyze the contract. But if we binding for the next five years? And may we better look at this risk a little bit harder, or have the right honest conversations with the customers. Account Management wall. Can't really see it here. But we managed to come back to that in a minute. But these are all of our customers for coaching on one side of the wall and over studio customers. So every week we stand in front of there, how do we know our customers are happy? How are we doing? And it's not just me saying, Hey, I went and visited my customer and they love us. Right? How are we actually going to really validate that we're providing customer delight, are we actually keeping an eye on on that ball and making sure we're doing it, we have these physically cut on boards. So we took a bandsaw we took those trifold boards, we cut them up, we glued magnets on them, because we found that we could then shift customer priorities right a lot quicker on the whiteboard. Another reason why we don't use tools, if I were to put this in a tool, I would have to wait for the software developer to add a feature so that I could do that. Right, versus just making a paper and moving it. And so we kind of create this if you could origami and crafts if you're going to be in kindergarten. Alright. So this is a big visual room. This is an example down here I can speak around Cardinal people in the room. Anyway. So Cardinal Health or few center, went and did a big visual room. We started with their vision, their mission, their purpose, their value stream map, how they're structured today, how they could be structured in the future for more flow. We created a whole ton of walls and this was a new team really high powered team right? You know, create an innovation center and throw your slouches in there, right? So you throw all these higher energy people and say go be innovative and go Agile and Go Lean and do this thing. Well, they all again, have various degrees of knowledge, Gary's degrees of influence various degrees of, of responsibility. So the first thing we agreed we need to do is start getting on the same page. So we started visualizing everything they worked on product portfolios, you know, they were a new organization, but they inherited about 25 Different software assets. Right? They had, this is our backlog. So this is us, the team agreeing on what walls are we going to build, and who's going to build them with us, because I don't know anything about your company. So if you can explain it to me and make it provision on the wall, and I can understand it, I'm the new guy, then that means I'm probably the lowest denominator, and everybody can probably read it, right? Whether I'm interviewing somebody, or anybody, I want them to have that clarity about who we are. And what we're doing. These are the three delights we manage. So we have customer walls, people walls in business walls. So we have to balance these things are people that work for Lean dog have to be happy, right? It has to make business sense, right? We have to make a living, right, and our customers have to be delight. So we'll then take these delights, and map them to the walls. And almost every organization, when we go in, and we first do this, two out of three of these would be really good, and one's gonna be neglected. That's why we create this wall, right? To say, hey, how do we really know that we're managing customer delight? You know, how are we 100% certain that we're doing that, because we get so busy, that it's really easy to focus on ourselves, to focus on the business and the people side and lose and sometimes lose sight of the customer. And if they aren't happy, then these don't exist. So we really have to keep that balance together. This is an example of a customer company alignment wall that somebody in here might think looks familiar. We have an ideation wall. This was how do we do innovation. So we had at the time, it was called shots on goal. Now I think they climb mountains or something. But But nonetheless, you know, we had inherited all these application assets. We were the innovation center, but we didn't have any capacity to innovate. And so we had to say, how do we actually create a new PMO flow that lets us test hypothesis and go more lean startup on this thing? Right? How do we how do we do that? And how we and if we're going to do that innovation way? How do we do it more like a shark tank way where you're in a large company, and everybody throws some funding in the build this beautiful thing. That means everybody wants capacity. But we aren't playing the capacity game anymore. We're playing on the highest value thing. What's the highest value shot on goal we can take? Right? And that's that's the play that you run, right? writ large, largest politically what people want to do. So we often have to go and create different demand funnels that aren't just run the business demand funnels verse, I want to take, I want to take some risk and do some startup stuff. So a lot of PMO work goes into these rooms. We have current product portfolios, we have new products, are these products displacing these products, what's the health of this product is going up is going down? It's going flat? How do we measure whether it's healthy? Are we good? Are we willing to have the guts to kill off a product so that we can build more capacity to do innovation? Right? So again, a lot of PMO work trying to understand how does the value flow in your organization? And when you first do this, and you put it up? These are the aha moments you have like, well, I just don't have enough. I want more of this. And I don't have to agree. Okay, if we all agree, and we only have so much capacity, then what are we not going to do to create capacity to do more of this? Right. And that's often has to sit at the CIO CEO level, making sure that we actually take these chances that we're continually innovating. Large companies can't grow growth by innovation, it's kind of hard, right? Because you kind of acquire a culture that squash a culture, product goes away. So we really have to figure out we can innovate from within more mapping. We have lots of key performance indicators. Every wall has some elements who owns the wall. How often who participates? When, how often do we look at the wall, almost every meeting we have is in front of a wall. It's not in a meeting room. There's nothing to hide, everybody. Everybody who works for us can see us standing in front of these walls, having meetings and trying to make decision and they might have insight. Right, so we don't hide any of this from them. And we don't lock it up and share points and wikis and tools and, and planning sessions. We just do it all in front of everybody all the time. Okay, that's probably enough on walls. Any questions about that? The visual room, tons of paper?

Yeah, so the question is, if it's all physical, what do you do when people aren't co located? So first, anytime you're distributed, there's going to be waste, okay? It's like a long distance relationship. It's takes me forever to build up trust takes a second to tear it down. Right? So nothing's ever going to replace this at first, you have to say, Are we structured? Do we recognize that if we all agree on that principle, then are we truly organized the most optimal way that we can so that we, we aren't as distributive one I might really like work with Srini. But he lives in California, and that's in we're in different time zones. So that may not happen, right? So recognize that's a constraint we have to overcome. It's only going to take work and trust. So I have to say, Okay, let me manage the exception. Not that so often what happens we tune our systems to the minority problem and So we want to optimize the whole. So we want to say 90% of people were on the boat, Sweeney's remote, how can we make sure you happy without dragging down the boat? That doesn't mean that the rest of the people have to shove something to tool to make Srini happy? I mean, it's, I have to have an honest conversation with saying, what information do you really need, and what's the best way we can do this. And when we played with all kinds of stuff, from video to taking photos to call somebody up at the end of the day, or, you know, sometimes it's cheaper to get on a plane, right, it's a once a month, we're gonna, we're gonna, we know, we're gonna start off the month really in sync, because I'm going to be like this with you. And then we're going to be working in this big visual room, we're going to take pictures and do the best we can to relate to you, maybe we'll create some dashboards and some PowerPoints, but for the most part, it's never going to replace being here. So once a month, we got to hook up into space and walk the room, right and get there. So big companies distributed just because they're big, if you're three stories away from somebody, you're distributed, so it's always a challenge. It's just you have to recognize recognize that it's hard. And once people work this way, you also find out that people don't necessarily, once you once you get on the same page with your system, you change it with intention. Okay? It's like just getting on the same page is tremendous. Right, you can now start seeing flows and handoffs. So the amount of change that you incur, is not as great as you would think it's an aha moment of understanding what the whole system looks like. And now saying, Okay, what incremental change are we going to try to make to the system? What parts are we going to try to so a lot of we are ceremonies. So we do we do two week sprints, right? During our sprints, we do a show until this, this wall that well that well that well, we then create a backlog of what things we need to change in our system. And then we got to change them. So at that point, I can go upstream and say, Hey, these are the five things we're going to change. It's not like we're changing the 1000. And you're that out of sync, right. And so you have to work hard at it, but it can, it can be done. A lot of people see all the paper and they get freaked out thinking that it's continually changing. Once we get the same lens, it kinda, it should change with like I said, with intention, if changes unexpectedly, that's when you retrospect and say, Whoa, what happened here? What caused the system to change? We lost flow up this it and now we're getting flown out here. So yes.

So you mentioned all the physical stuff, that's something that's been kind of a debate and in our company, so why does it have to be so physical with like, all the electronic boards that are accessible tools? Why is there really that body works?

So the question is, why does it have to be physical? Is it really worth about the values in the conversation? Okay, it's just like writing a story card, the value is having a conversation about what reality is, and saying, Trina, do you agree, Greg, do you agree? Is this the truth? This is truth. Now we can agree on the next countermeasure option, or card that we're going to play. And so it's a conversation where the value comes out. And the reason paper works is because it's cheap, Mike, I can change that wall any way I want. I can throw it up, I can rip it off. If I miss a meeting, and these guys are hanging out and I'm like, Oh, wow, okay, they got that wrong, I can write a post it note and stick it up there. I don't have to go dive into tool to find the mistake. Even everybody on the company can validate the wall. So if I go in and say I'm doing a practice level adoption wall, and you know, I can't read in your name. So dark in here, Mike says, Hey, we you know, our level, we do test driven development all the time. And there's a big smiley face up there by TDD for your team. And then Greg walks by and says, That's BS. You know, I paired with him last week, we don't do that. So what happens? It's like kindergarten homework gets tricky. If you have to go into a system and have to go in a system and then tweak that and say, Mike, you're wrong, right? There's this, it's hard, people just won't do it, they'll just avoid the conflict, rather than saying our duty is to always have the truth on the wall. First, go update the tool. If you put stuff in a tool, any good leader, if I if I have stuff in a tool, and I'm going in front of my board, what am I going to do? Hey, is this right? Is this right? Is this right? Did you update your data? I'm gonna go beat on everybody to ensure that they got the data right in the tool, because I don't want to look like an idiot saying, I don't know what's going on. Right? You're going to double check it anyways. You're always going to validate the tool before you make a critical or key decision anyways. So just make it physical and make even when we interview people, first thing they do, they come in, they walk the walls, okay, here's who we are. Here's what we do. Here's our products. Here's our sales funnel, here's their applications. Here's who we're trying to make happy. Here's how happy our business is. We're actually talking taking them through and explain them our culture in our systems, and how people work. And at the end that walk on the wall, I hope they say Well, here's how I can help. Right? Here's how my skills fit into this. And I've worked with this customer and I can do this, right, so we're actually testing them as well to see if they can see the whole system. When I put it in tools. There's no way to connect those dots. And mind you you'll never have enough walls. So we only use the walls for the biggest problems. The most complicated things we need to solve deserve a wall. Every Friday after after standup. We do two things. First, we put on polka music. And because everybody hates polka music, sorry if there's anybody that likes it, but but when we clean we clean for 15 minutes. Why? Because it's our house. We built our house, we wanted to be clean. When go away from the weekend. We want to come back on Monday. The second thing we do is we clean off the walls. We go and say okay, well what was this wall over here for Oh, because you know we're brainstorming on this solution and we came up with it. Okay, maybe now we can make this a little prettier, make it take up this much space. and save that precious wall space to put our minds on. It's hard, but you have to try once you try it and you get that big room going. That's why we believe in the big room. If you can get to see how things connect in the system and see the whole system, yes.

checks that are visible, though. I still like that's kind of what I'm talking about some more of the visible, electronic.

We'll do some of that. We'll roll some things up in a PowerPoint like we have a company meeting once a month on a Friday. And yeah, I'm because I have people dialing in, I will summarize some things in a PowerPoint. But oftentimes, it's just pictures of the walls. And we're just telling you the highlights of the wall, you can't even read it. We're like, Hey, these are three cool things about this wall, this will change. But yeah, you're right. I mean, the value, somebody takes a break. And I got I got a developer, a designer downstairs and they take a break, and they come up because we get the beer, right? And they come upstairs and they're like, Hey, what's going on over here, and they'll stand there, and they'll just absorb the walls. And now they're having good questions with you that you wouldn't wouldn't had the opportunity. So that whole walk that you know, leadership by walking around, well, everybody can walk, why did Can't they walk up there and see how we're leading?

Just the support, answered after the last few questions. The first question around, why should it be physical? I think if you've got to co locate a team, physical is significantly better. Because John and I have been working together for many, many years. Wild Things is like the haptic response of me riding a cart and going up there and putting up the actually does mean something because the sense of accountability for the person was very different than somebody else who right and breaks it up in an electronic format. And it's out there is a competition, picking it up and moving it into that next step is important. So again, people are haptic learners, most people learn by experience or having that is important when you've got people who are co located back to the people, what teams are not co located using tools, actually does help with what John talked about is real, like we've done multiple times back and forth on the right way. But using tools does help. But the key to remember is back to it this is one of the cool things I like to get done is always thinking about the mean and waste, right. So when you go electronic, you gotta cut this, think about what waste is. And so if I'm using the electronic, whether you're using Trello, whatever it is, if that electronic board is your system of record for what you're doing, then it's not wasted. It's because you can always put these cards into more than Lego you run your standup based on the electronic board, and you do everything that you started when you missed the happy component of it, that's you deal with that, it becomes a problem when it becomes like one of these things where in order to collaborate with somebody else I've done update that electronic, a secondary system where my primary data is stored, stored somewhere else, and I got converted into cards and that it's not working. It's a complete waste.

And we'll pay administrative people to do that work. Right we'll bring in interns will say hey, listen, just gotta keep this thing in sync, sync if it's that important. The other thing too is I keep one of the one of the biggest ways is late and skills. And when you start making things physical, like we had a Melissa she's probably our newest hire, she came from with a business background. She's helped with recruiting and people systems. And all sudden I thought she was like just amazing artists like she was she takes notes on a talk, she doesn't like taking notes like I do. She like draws pictures, and makes things a story. And like, wow, you could be a designer, like I saw a skill come out and her then now there's a crib and now I say Hey, make these walls pretty, make them readable. And so all of a sudden everybody can improve the system. However they can improve it. So with her with her artistic skills, I had no idea that she had now she's improving the system. And it's quite often even, you know, by them coming to me is like, hey, maybe there's a better way for us to organize this wall by system and they come up with these creative solutions to do it. It's just fun. Making things physical. It's fun when we do things software is all day long. Creating physical things on the wall. It's delightful. I don't see any other way. Good. Any more questions? Here, why don't we get on time. Okay, let's talk now a little bit more about Standard Work pair management. So we pair we don't just pair it the developer level that he's or send his line to team level we pair when we manage. Okay, writing an email is almost like writing code. Okay, if I'm writing a really important email to you, I'm kind of like, Hey, Greg, is this clear? Is this concise? And we're trying to solve a problem trying to influence somebody or get something done. So writing that email, I could take a week and do it. I could take two hours I could take 10 minutes. When we pair we do just enough, right? And so one of the biggest you know, one of the biggest things we're creating our own backlog in demand. We can work forever on something we can refactor reanalyze finally Gregor say dammit just go talk to right. Just stop. This is pick up the phone. We started doing an experiment we actually do voice recordings replies to emails now, because writing has no inflection. And the biggest reason we lose trust is I write one sentence bad and you think I'm pissed off, right? So some like the tone, or caps or exclamation point instead of a period, right? One little thing that tries to show emotion inflection, because we so damaging, that voicemail is very, a very dangerous thing. So we actually try to avoid and I'll show you, I'll show you the extreme lengths, we go to avoid emails, which is kind of hard. So again, you get by pairing, you kind of do just enough, you make less mistakes. And it keeps us honest. So if I'm working with Greg and I'm working with, he's like, What, don't forget, we got to get this statement of work out, or we got to call shimmy, we got to do this, right, he'll make sure that I'm working on on the easiest order, which is really easy to do, especially in the morning, we don't have your coffee, right, versus Hey, I'm gonna tackle my hardest problem that day first, and work on the highest value thing first, right? Even if it's not the hardest problem. So it keeps us honest, and what we're working on saying, okay, is this really what we should be spending time on right now. So we'll ping pong pair, Greg and I do a lot except his driving, and we'll go there. Alright, we do improvement heights, we do a lot of outdoor activities. A three strategy management, I won't go too much in that either. So let's talk about how you manage your backlog. So the biggest challenge we have as leaders is your backlog is infinite. So how do you guys manage it? Right? Everybody here probably has a slightly different personal time management system. Okay. One of things we had to agree as a leadership team, if we're going to actually problem hydraform team, we need to work the same way. This is no different when we teach our Scrum teams. Right. We have certain cadences we're going to ceremonies right story cards, right acceptance criteria, right test. First, we're going to we define all the standard work around application delivery. But as leaders, what are we going to do to manage our backlog, we don't have a clear product owner, we are the product owner. And we can create a lot of product, right? And whatever it may be. So you have emails, you have voicemails, you have LinkedIn, you have text, you have all these things that you have to process and forgot what to work on next, right? So it's kind of overwhelming. So this is how we do it. Every morning, we have a leadership stand. And this is not perfect. Believe me. This is the hardest thing I've ever tried to do in my career. So if anybody here can discover a better way, please share it with me. We have a couple of companies trying to do this with us was really hard. So this is our daily stand up. So this is my leadership team. This is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, all we do in the mornings, we say what are the top three things that we want to get done today? Just three, okay. And the goal is to stand up and say, Do I need any help with anything? Hey, Greg, can you bear with me on this? This proposal? Can you bear with me on this customer visit whatever it is? When are we traveling? So we try to we try to travel Mondays and Fridays or be on the boat Mondays and Fridays midweek we're up. We're managing customer late and people too late. That's that's the pattern we're on right now. We try to get to inbox zero. So how many people read the book Getting Things Done GTD? Right. Okay, good. So right, you do defer delegate or delete, right. So when something comes in your purview, you can either do it and get it done. Right? If it's quick, right? You can defer it like, Oh, crap, I don't want to write that email, right there. Delegate it like, Greg, can you go to this meeting for me? Or delete it? Right? This is noise, I'm not going to process it. It's wasted inventory. Let me just get out of here. Use your down thumb button a lot, right, and get rid of a lot of junk that just comes in. Everything that comes in there is irrelevant to you delivering value, all that junk mail that takes you away from your train of thought just for a second just to process it, even if it's just like, oh god, why am I so start to get rid of the junk. Like, I do that all the time, I still can't get rid of it. But keep trying. So now we need to make our work visible. So we agreed to these kind of basic values. If we all work the same way. We all use the same time management system to process our backlog, emails, voicemails, meetings, text, all that they will have a better insight to what we're all working on. Therefore, we can make better decisions what to do. And we better will be better because it's really easy for me to delegate not knowing what's on your plate. Hey, Greg, can you help me do these two things? I'm president you aren't whatever your power controls happen, right? I tried to give it to you why don't know that you have three statements work getting done, you've promised the three people something, and that's what you're doing is higher value. So we have to have a way to expose our backlog. We often mismanagement commitments, because we just don't know that. I also don't have the freedom. Like I can't go speak at conferences or travel or teach or do what I like to do if my backlog isn't exposed, because I can't show people what I have as a responsibility. And I can't even make a trade off to say, am I gonna speak here and here and here? Am I gonna go on a speaking tour? If I have too much backlog, and nobody else can absorb my backlog? Right, what's going to happen? I have to make a value decision. And I can't do that unless I can truly manage it. So Inbox Zero. I'm not that good at drawing. So but basically, you have meetings, you have personal things you want to do your personal life, you have projects, you have departments you're supporting, right, you have options, you can do defer, delegate, delete, so we use Trello because it's free, and we forward things into Trello. So this is how we get to Inbox Zero. I have to take my my inbox is my worst possible queue for project management. I can't sort I can't do what I want to do. I mark things on red I flag things I shove stuff in folders, it just becomes unruly, right? It's I'm in like a dam like faster than I can actually get rid of the water, it's coming in all the time. So if I don't shove that somewhere so I can actually manage it, I can't do that an email and find out a way to do that better than this, let me know. So we create a personal Trello boards, everybody on our leadership team has one, we create a list in there called inbox zero, we then go in and generate an email address, so we can forward things into that email. So I can forward any email with attachments, whatever it takes into it. Okay. I have a standard school list I'll show you. And then I have a calendar view. So this is one of my, this is one view of my board, she has a Trello board, I forget everything in inbox zero, then I take it and I move it out. I can't read it. But this is my boat names to 25. That's a whole number. So in managing the ship, there's things I have to worry about. Product Development, these are new ideas of things, I want to build some day, things I need to read, I get a lot of stuff like everybody read this, read this, read this read this, I have to pit I have to reserve my reading time, whether I'm driving down here to Columbus, or I'm on a plane, or it's quiet time, some time. I can't just read every article that I think every learning opportunity comes in front of my face. So I have to batch it up. Right? So I batch it up. And when it gets too big, then I'm like, Well, I've heard a burn down this backlog. Or you know what, I was really interested in this topic. And now I'm not that interested in anymore. So I'm gonna start deleting it. Right when we had a great lunch discussion. And in a Sarah sent me a whole bunch of great stuff on whole philosophy. And I was like, Oh, that's great. But now we don't really care anymore. So I have to actually hone that backlog down. I have other boards. So here's just backlog, here's conferences, here's things I need to schedule, here's things I scheduled two weeks out, because we're one week out. So the key is every meeting I make is is consuming my capacity. It's burning down on my available availability of my 40 hours a week. So I have to manage that. Because once I accept a meeting, I made a promise. It's no different than I promised a product owner, I was gonna deliver them something. Okay, I made a commitment that I was gonna scope at your meeting, and I was gonna do something. So I better take heed of that first, right. Otherwise, we're gonna burn respect, I'm going to start missing meetings and devalued and we're canceling. If I don't think I should go to the meeting, I need the courage to say that's not my highest value. Thanks for inviting me to these next 10 meetings. But that's not really where I'm focused right now. And I trust you guys. I have two other smart people in the room. They're on my team, they'll let me know what's going on. Okay, so say no to meetings, meetings are a big commitment. You figure if you have three or four meals a day you lost 50% of your capacity. Okay, so it's in and how many people here have more than three meetings a day? Right? Yeah, that's our life, right when you get into leadership. So the reason I do it this way is because what I do is I, I actually add a due date and Trello. And the reason I add a due date is now I can pivot to a calendar view. And so here's where I use tools, because my backlog is so unruly. I tried to make this all physical and then travel, I just couldn't do it. I just can't take that much paper with me. So now I can look and say, Well, this is actually last year look. Last year, okay, I'm just going to path agility to maintain t. So these are things that immediately I have during this week's Alright, for appointments. So now what I can do is I can drag my backlog in and fill in the rest of my capacity based on value, no, am I am I going to learn today? Am I going to execute on a project? What am I going to do beyond just these meetings? Again, this looks, this is really hard to do.

And it's really easy to get behind, like, just come to this conference for next couple of days, I'm gonna get buried, and I know I'm gonna have to unbury so I'm gonna have to block time that get unburied on Friday, because I need to get my backlog back into value priority is just going to load up. And there's going to be things that are higher value coming in that need response. So it's really hard to do. Some people have you know, this is Alyssa, just my one of my creatives she, she does people systems, and she creates it on her desk, by when no one listens to my walk up. And her post it notes are on her desk a lot smaller than mine, when you're president, you get inundated with every request for everything in the world. So people have different various degrees, I don't care how they do their backlog, as long as it's visible. If you aren't traveling like me, and this works for you. Beautiful. Now when I go up to interrupt her, I can say oh, I'm cutting in front of our PTO policy or I'm doing right. And I know exactly what her feature what her Epic is that she's working on. And I can make an educated decision about whether my car is really more valued than hers. Questions about that?

Yes. So you put that together you all everybody? Yep.

So it's a question was everybody gets hit? Yes. Do I have to track people down? Out of a dozen of us, maybe two or three of us are doing it on a regular basis because it's hard. Right? Somebody has to be there to say I'm gonna try to flush this system out. Yeah, it's really hard to do. And so we need to get better at it. There's, there's times we're really good. And there's times when we're really bad. And we're, hey, wait, we agreed we're going to try to work the same way. Let's get back to it. So it's like any system passing picks up here and we start skimping on practice standard work down here. Have I measured it to see if this is really providing the value in the effort it takes? I don't have a better have a way to do this yet I wish I had everybody had an assistant to help them organize all their backlog and hone it and say, Hey, shift the value around. I think that might be easier. But I'll take that. So yeah, if anybody wants to try this and help us figure it out, it's, it's hard, but it's something we'll get there. Alright, any other questions? Anybody could try this? All right. Let me know how it goes. Because I always say that and I never get to hear back. And I'd love to know. Yeah, I'm sorry, good.

Luck backlog in or cuts through the project, where you have multiple stakeholders, individual stakeholders, the theory. So what I said it already comes with that as initiatives such as ethics.

Yep, so the problem is, this is just stuff that comes in mostly in my inbox in my meeting calendar, right. So this is Microsoft and Gmail at work, right? Then there's products and projects that I'm working on, right, there's so many other things, I have to as a leader, we do that today, just everybody does it differently. Some of those are in Trello boards, and I can just look at my all view, and I can see it or not, some of them were just on the walls, and they don't exist at all. So I have to figure out a way to juggle that. And so sometimes, what I'll do is take the really important stuff on the walls, and I'll create a Trello card, it just all takes time data entry sucks, it just takes time, right. And so if you're gonna really look at your backlog, and you have to get it all on a system, it's gonna take time and even find a way to do that. So, so various degrees of doing that, I'll probably leave here after two days. And now, I'll just shove everything in there. And then I'll eventually get organized. And I'll eventually walk the project walls and say, Okay, what did I miss while I was on the road, and I'll try to update that. But it's not definitely not a perfect system. But the fundamental thing here is we all are trying to agree to work the same way. Because we make our teams do that. And so we want to practice what we preach if our teams can work one way, why can't even though we're individuals, why can't we try to work, even if we don't work 100% The same way, let's just go in that direction. And everybody do the best they can. And we think we think we'll make better decisions on value and priorities by doing that. And more important, we'll drop less balls. Most people when you're in leadership, you wake up worrying about what balls you dropped. Right? All the little things you didn't do, not all the things you did. Right. And that's, that's it's hard. It's hard to organize that. There's too much. Okay. All right. Another form of waste, we tend to over process, a lot of people think Agile is about creating a democracy and let everybody agreeing on what we should do and what we shouldn't do. That's not true. What we really need to do is is not work. So work so hard at getting 100% consensus. So we'll go into place was, hey, we make a decision about you know, what, what do we have for lunch, and everybody has an opinion, or whatever it is. And I'm like, Okay, I'm reading you, I don't think you really agree with me, I'm gonna commit to you why we should go here. So that's a really lame example. But but anything you do, because we want to be socially accepted. We go for we want everybody to 100% agree. And often that we don't need that, we just need to agree that, hey, we're over a tipping point. Let's just try it. And let's learn from it. So a couple of frameworks that we've teach people. So this one's called fist to five. So again, kindergarten, Paper, Scissors, Rock, VISTA, five, hey, you guys all want to take a break here in five minutes? And we say hell yeah, hell no. Kind of in the middle, okay, kind of over the middle. I'm more on the top end, kind of want to do that. So by doing quick throw down decisions like this, we don't over analyze, we're doing this at Cardinal diffuse. And we did, we're making like, 2025 decisions in the morning when we first started as a team, because we're, Hey, should we buy a couch? Should his chair be blue? Should this whiteboard be, you know, magnetic or not? Right? We're a new team. So we were all trying to get consensus, and not upset anybody because we're storming, norming, we're perform. We're trying to do that. So so we decided we could just do these things, and everything. And most of the time, we're all three are up, right? So right, okay, let's just try. What's the worst thing that happen, we just go in that direction, we don't have to have a meeting and talk about the pros and the cons and this and go get public consensus and do it, let's just, let's just take a chance, let's do something. So so this is we actually have an app you can download. It has a lot of these tools and cards in it. As an example, these guys don't win in the morning. And, you know, every once in a while you're gonna get one of these and you're gonna get a rock, right? You're gonna say, wow, we're really different on this. You're like, hell no, hell yes. You too should talk. And then come back to us until we Why Why are you so adamant against it? When you say admin for Oh, because the way John said it. He made it sound like it was gonna be that way forever. And it wasn't just an expense or whatever it is, right? Or, you know, I actually have some data points on this. I understand this. And I've done this, and this is what happened. And I've been here longer. And I know that you know, before we do this, we're going to talk to facilities we're going to talk to so and so, and we need to get a little bit more consensus before we just make that. That's great. That's insight we use. So now we bring that in Say back to a team and say, Hey, listen, we just learned from Mike, you know, this is what he thinks is going to happen what he does when we vote again. And often it'll change substantially. If it can't change, then we'll do six thinking hats. So many people familiar with this. Right? Edward de Bono old stuff, right? We just reuse what works. So this is a simple book where you basically have a facilitator come in the room, they wear the blue hat, and they force us through the emotional process states we're in. So maybe Greg's isn't a bad day, and he's black hat and everything, right? We say, Okay, well, first, what are all the if we're going to do this thing? What's the worst possible thing that can happen? We all brainstorm on the worst possible outcome? What's the best possible outcome? How do we feel about this, like what feelings strike us when we talk about it? So we basically go through these emotional hats. Now we have some data up on the board. Now we can take another vote. And often this moves us and I've done this for things like, I don't code anymore. Try, but I don't and so that I hear developers arguing about technical frameworks, and they can't agree on which way we're gonna go, and they do all this mock this, let's try this. And then we, we do a sixth thinking hat on it. And all of a sudden, we come out with a direction that, you know, it wasn't the loudest person in the room. So we're trying to give everybody a voice, right in the decision making process, which, without dragging it on forever. So that's what these frameworks are meant to do is to kind of make decisions quickly as a team. And then when we don't agree, come up with a process to try to get their agreement, right, and try to get there fast, right? Because we don't want to over process over wait. We don't want delays delay decisions. If it's slowing up how we work as a leadership team are causing emotional unrest on our team, we need to resolve the conflict because as conflict lingers, it slows down the system. Right? Geez. And Craig's pisted, John, and John's business training series, right? And it's like, all this, like black cloud starts falling over everything. So we just need to get these things cleared. It's a simple framework. Another technique we do this is you're going to follow Edison's management, three to book and he adapted from somebody and then we adapted it. But basically, this is talking about how many people are familiar with RACI, responsible accountable consultant for him, right? Oh, yeah, PMI folk, right? So this is an example where, hey, we're thinking about throwing this great agile conference, okay. And we know that to do the conference, like we all voted, oh, yeah, let's do this thing, right? We all have our backlog somewhat organized. So we know what our commitments are. Now, we've just signed up for the work. So we're like, Okay, so tell Sal, this is kind of the responsible, accountable side. For me, it's I want to be involved with the location of the venue, but I want to, like, agree with someone on it, I don't want to tell you where it's going to be. I don't want just give you my opinion, I'd like to have a say in the decision making process. So what happens we put up we know for a company location, food and drink advertising, money and speakers. So now we put our names up here, and we're like, wow, okay. So often, more often than not, everybody puts their names over here. They're like, wait a second, I thought it was an awesome idea. But I didn't think I was gonna have to do all this work, right, I thought you would get the speakers you would do the food, you would do this. And I would just show up for two days and, you know, get a free lunch and hang out. And so by doing this, you could start seeing or, you know, hey, this time Bill, sign up for the food and drink and he served rice and beans. Right. And Amy gave her opinion, right? But Bill made this, you know, he was ultimately responsible, accountable. So now the next time I go to do this, I'm not going to maybe maybe next time for the food venue. Since I didn't like the way it went. I'm response removing myself over here. And taking more responsibility and accountability for it, it happens, rather than sitting back here and just judging what happened. Okay, so creating these kinds of responsibility charts, you know, work, and it makes it It's physical. So you can't hide, I can't go after the conference, a bill. Remember, you were here. And the food was in the survey said the food was horrible at that conference. And yeah, you know, maybe at some point, we could have raised our hand and said, hey, I can use a little bit of help with the food here. Because, you know, I don't have enough budget, or I didn't, you know, didn't have enough support, right, and getting it done. And so, you know, it creates this kind of, again, accountability, culture, and people will shift based on what they know. So, the last thing, so we talked about that was standard work. Now we're gonna talk about continuous improvement. Okay, so the one of the best books I listened to lately, one of my friends here in Columbus had read, listen to this, it's on Audible, or you can download for free Leanpub. It took an hour and a half. If you put it on speed, level three, I run at speed level five. So three is not too bad. But if you run out three is about an hour and a half. There's three additions to this. You can listen to the first edition and get most of it. But this guy runs a woodworking plant, and all he does is implement tools, Lean tools that improve the woodworking process. I'm not a woodworker, but it was really interesting. His whole industry is reduced around creating eliminating waste in the wood carpentry practice. So the notion he came up with these pretty crazy guy is you should improve everything by two seconds every day. So rather than have big Kaizen events, what you do is you try to improve you improve every day. So every day, I listened to Paul and we're trying this is an experiment. I mean, I wear this goofy sign. I take an iPad, and I walk around right and I asked people some questions right? On video. Okay. I give them they have 15 minutes to improve roof. It was 30. We took it back to 15. He does an hour in his shop. And we say, Okay, what's your name? What bugs you? Why Does it bug you? How did you fix it? what ways did you eliminate, and these are the forms of waste, right? Eight Deadly Sins of Lean waste, and give credit to anybody that helped you. So I don't care if you're going to go fix the way a desk is organized, I don't care, whatever you're going to do something your environment bugs you something little around you. So we want that to be part of your culture every day, we created a lean doc Kaizen channel, these are some of the things we did, whether it's post it notes, we're arguing about our overhead calculation, using Kaizen foam to organize our flippers, Randy's here, the curd coffee machine came out, we have to read a barcode. So we had to hack it to make the coffee flow better. So we have all these different improvements. And this is an example of one I'm just to give you an idea how this goes.

Hi, I'm John Stoll. And what bugs me is printing, we have a two story boat here floating in Cleveland. And we have to run downstairs to get stuff when we printed to do one big printer down there. So I'm sitting here working right. Now I gotta go get it. So follow me on my journey, and you will see the waste ensues.

You don't want to

hear that? Didn't even print, which happens a lot from printer, which is another waste that defect. But let's assume it did print, let me get it and I'll walk back upstairs. Meanwhile, I'm most likely to get distracted by somebody. So chances are I don't make it back to my desk without talking to someone and shifting what I'm focusing on, which is another form.

Okay, so fact, that took a long time, lots of opportunity to not focus on what I was focusing on. So Lisa and I did some calculations, it's about 36 seconds each way, takes about 60 steps, it's about 72 seconds, every time we have to do that. We took a poll in the office, it kind of informal, and we think we print probably about an average seven times a day, we have about seven people that make that journey seven times a day. So we're basically wasting about 58.8 minutes a day. So call it an hour, an hour per day, which is almost 251 hours a year. So Lisa and I bought a printer. And we had a printer here before but it wasn't a network printer, couldn't print color couldn't print duplex. So that's what forced us to get out of the better printer. And the crappy printer nobody wanted to use because you had to plug in with a USB stick time and energy. And so now with this thing, we can plug into the network, it's also wireless. And we're gonna save a crapload of time. So what do we say? I mean, there's a ton of stuff, defects, processing, transportation, waiting, loss of potential of employees, because we're getting distracted with conversations as we make that journey. So this was a huge improvement. And our two Secondly, improvements. So thanks to Lisa Schindler for giving me a hand. So that's a more elaborate one, we actually have data behind it. But it can be up just about anything, you can go check out our videos and see what we do. It's the notion is that it's easy to for us as leaders to pick the big improvements. But if you pick all the little things around you, and you just improve on them, it's part of your culture, it's not good enough just to see that this is bugging me is inefficient. We organize it. So we actually like anything, we have standard work. So this is our standard work. We do our daily stand up. We do our show Intel during the show until I display the two second and pretty proven videos from the day before we Bang a Gong, we have a gong Srini looks familiar. I had like these all over nationwide funds on but we Bang a Gong because we're celebrating that we've improved something just because it's fun. It's good to hit things. We declare our next improvement, right? And then we work on it and we work on it. We shoot the video, we upload it. This is where you can get the book. This is our chart. So we actually charted out on the wall. Are we making improvements? We aren't doing this at the moment, we chose to do something else improvement wise. But it was I liked the notion because rather than big Kaizen events on big process big changes. It's just like do something low. You start every day with a stand up, and then you improve something small that makes you smile and say this a little bit better than it was yesterday, even if it's small. And then you're off to a good day, right? It just kind of sets that culture that everybody can improve anything in the system. No matter what it is. Even the small things are just as important as the big things. So it's just part of the DNA. We bought this nice work cabinets, we can organize our tools and make things that are gone. Last point here is sacred cows. So often we go into cultures we start radiating out who you You're in what you are. There's always something hanging out there. Oh, yeah, but this but that or don't do this or why is he doing that? Right? There's always this back channel of things and these things, these, these things can be really big like, Okay, you Srini would never like this, like, what do we ask him? When No, he just never has? What do we have the courage to say, hey, Shireen, you know what the hell like, like, can we talk? This is really like slowing down our system. The belief is we can't try this. Most leaders operate the improve the entire system, if there's something they're doing, or some behavior that's perceived, it's, there's, there's a gap between reality and perception, right? And we need to find that in between. Right? If you're gonna create a continuous improvement culture, you got to get that in between nine times out of 10, we hear this perception, and then we go to check reality and we're like, okay, there's some truth to that. Not enough truth to create all this process, all this fear, all the stress, all this concern, and all these reasons why you can't improve. And so to do that, we implement like a token in Cleveland, we just were on a boat, we picked the manatee. So we got Boomer. And down here in Columbus, we created Bruce a sacred cow, their office happens to be next to landscaping place. So there was a cow there. But it's just a symbol saying, Do we have any sacred cows and as a leader, you have to check that, right? Because the best leaders in this room want to know their say they want to know what their what what's bogging us down. And it's often I said, perception is not reality, once thing was said one time, and it became the reason that things can't improve or reason things can't be done. So this is just like a little symbol that we use to remind people, those things exist. We actually lean dog use these, this comes from extreme programming. So CC, fr, LS, we added the l live. But basically, anytime I'm about to have a crucial conversation with somebody, I want to go and keep it going sure anybody should use ECFR or A or C, or LS. I'm saying that saying, Hey, I'm trying to improve here, it's my safe word. So don't just take attack, I'm like really going to have a crit I'm about to give you a courageous feedback, or ask you something hard. And so I don't I can't remember the manifesto, or the Lean rallies and principles. I can least remember these letters. And we know when we hear those letters that hey, don't get your hackles up, we're actually going to have a hard conversation in the best intention of moving, moving our team forward. Right. So having saved for it's part of psychology, sociology, very important, have them in your culture, use them. Don't make them just lip service. So it doesn't work. See didn't work

don't have a cursor, you'll see your cursor at

this top top left, I can't see it on my screen. Oh, I can see it over there. Okay, there.

We had just moved into the building. We've been here about a week, we were really trying to drive a new culture. From the first moment that people walked in the door and started working here we have a large culture change going on. And moving to agile practices, both from an engineering perspective and a management perspective,

with the startup effort, like what we were going through that we had a lot to accomplish in a short period of time. So how to gain consensus and then communicate that outward was, was a big challenge.

We had a perception from our teams that we weren't communicating effectively, they brought

us a lean methodology that we didn't have. So we either had the choice of creating something from scratch on our own. Or we could leverage somebody like lienzo to help us get there quickly.

And they brought a lot of great experience from the market. And two things that we could do to both engineering practices to how we get teams executing a different way, thinking about things a different way, as well as bringing in a lot of kind of visual management techniques and lean techniques.

In a world now where everybody's all about storing information electronically. They kind of went the other direction said let's put this information out in a big invisible way and show everybody what we're doing.

One of the most surprising bonuses of the engagement is we learned a lot of collaboration tools,

all the conversations that we had helped to get some priorities out on the table it helped get some problems out on the table

lean dog was really fun to work with. They have a lot of great energy. They're very transparent, honest and real people Lindahl

helped us one with the lean, agile methodology. They brought in a package solution they were able to implement immediately to they brought the experience and the techniques to convey that information and three, just the energy and creativity to pull that off and and to get excited about

so So I taught you guys everything I know. So you go do this, right, you don't need us. So sounds great, great kit. But basically, you know what we believe what is speed and lean right? Seeing your standard work so you can improve the system, creating a continual improvement things, whether it's retrospectives to second liens, Kaizen events you need to have, he didn't know what your improvement steps are, with safe words and things to do that as well. And then creating people systems creating the best people systems you can so you can uncover your skill if you can get rid of waste, continually improve, see the standard work the same way, you're much better chance to create and a high performing organization. This is actually the boat before we renovated it was a restaurant. That's a submarine, if you ever come up. And that's it. That's what we talked about. Questions? Am I out of time? Five minutes? Yes,

I remember you started at nationwide. Okay. I was thinking, Where did I come from? That's, I remember you showing us how it set up and everything. Yes, the Agile requirements.

I would say it starts off I remember you. I can put my helmet back on.

Some questions? Okay. Oh, how much do you spend every year on post it notes? Yeah. If we own stock, right, yeah. What's funny is, if you saw one of the pictures, we start with a brown paper, just go buy a roll kraft paper for 10 bucks. And we actually learned that from one of our colleagues and products, Jeff Patton. That's all he uses brown paper, because he gets painted tape and brown paper and doesn't even go to make it pretty even though he's a designer. So you can start cheap. And we spent a lot of money on magnets to and all kinds of different creative sticky clips. And

we've created a brand new innovation space, right? It's great new shiny that we just opened. Right when Windows, right? But we don't really have whiteboards. But in a meeting room, we do right on Windows. They don't want to sleep anything up. They want pristine clean. So what kinds of things can we take back to them saying, Hey, this is really the way to go.

So everybody hear that? Okay, so the question was, they have this innovation open room, but people still don't mess up the walls because they want to clean right? So that's usually facilities or HR or somebody that says, Yeah, we have to create a process is messy. Right? The Apple Store innovation doesn't happen in the Apple Store. Right? Right. That's where they showcase their products. So don't make your place look like the Apple store. It drives me nuts, I kind of sometimes I'm a clean freak, sometimes not. But when I go by my space, and I see our makers was just stuff ever I wish this was all organized and neat and tidy. But I have to respect that it's it's a creative process, and they're going to make it messy. So typically, we'll help educate facilities. So first, we'll take them on tours of other customers, and and make them comfortable with the notion that it can be really different. And then there's a couple of videos, we show them the idea of shopping cart, video, gold. And what we do is when we see that video, as part of our class two is you'll see a high performing team. And when you see a high performing team, that's what everybody wants. Right? In fact, are we yeah, we got a lot of cool toys, right? We have a lot of fun. Some of the best teams I work with aren't don't they don't have that stuff. And they're still awesome, awesome teams, because it gets stuff done. If they're shipping value building great products for their customers, they have fun. So we often we give people tours will show them the shiny places or place the fuse other places, right. But then we'll also take them to the people who are not necessary in a basement. They have a couple of windows. But that's about all they have. You know you were there two years. Yeah. Right. And that was one of the happiest teams ever saw. And they had the least, but they are shipping great product. And the product owners love them. So it didn't matter. Because they went home every day after kindergarten say we did the best damn job we could we learned the most we're the most transparent. So. But yeah, it's worked with your facilities. Sometimes you get an outside opinion saying, Hey, can you can you take a tour? And can you open their mind to usually when they see it? For some reason facilities, people have the best job security and they're like, they're forever. And so you see, and I remember back when it was like that here, back when we were a lot smaller, it was fun. It was creative, and it was energy. Now we're, you know, so So usually you have to find a way to connect with that person, psychology wise or sociology was.

comment that one of the practices that you have that at the end of the week or whatever, you go through your process and say, What do I need to clean up? That sounds like the process and you own your space.

So do retrospectives not just on your projects on your space? How's this boat working? Right? That's what we do. We make an intentional effort to say how's our how's our boat system working? How's our office system working? What can we do to make the environment we'll talk about the projects, just how we don't living on living on a boat together? Because we're all living on you know, We're all there. So we have to do it. So it's becomes pretty clear when you come into our culture that it's just it's standard work. It says on the wall Friday stand up the polka music. Don't sit down. It's like musical chairs, right? You sit down and that's bad. So we also Institute there's a concept I didn't talk about yet. But that's so one way to get norms stick is that penalize people, but in a fun way. So most humans are really bad at giving people saying bad things like hey, you're a slob. You know, you always leaving your coffee cup out, you're doing that. So we have a debt wall, like, Hey, if you leave if you leave your place messy Oh, two bucks, not because we want your two bucks. But we leave them like, Hey, did everybody agree that he just left his coffee cup there. And now I don't want to clean up after him. And I'm not gonna sit in his workspace. We have leave your cell phone unattended. If your phone phones on attend and you walk away and your wife keeps calling and is vibrating. You're like, okay, it's disrupting me. So when we do retrospectives on our space, some of the things that make it uncomfortable to work in that environment are social norms. Like what norms do we need to adhere to, we all agree that we shouldn't leave stuff around. We all agree we shouldn't leave cell phones and attended, we all agree that we should, you know, if you eat, you should wipe down your space after you eat. So then when we do our improvement things, you'll see things start popping up like hey, one of the reasons we don't clean up after we eat is we don't have access to cleaning materials. So let's make a spot on every desk where there's a clip thing of Clorox wipes on every desk. So now the barrier isn't you had to go fight there. Or the excuse can't be I didn't have any Clorox wipes, no, there's actually a round.on your table where they sit. And when that queue is empty, we're going to put another one there. So you always have cleaning supplies, there's all these little things we do in a work opening workspace environment to make it work. But having a way to pick on people's good. We did it one time we did it up in Cleveland, when I was at nationwide, and we had we built up so much debt, that we actually had to have a way to pay it down because everyone was people were earning so much money initially. So we had a pet food eating contest day, if you could eat natural, natural pet food, you could pay down your debt. It was a fun team building event that HR didn't like me for it. But we sure had fun doing it. Right. And it was just it's just you have to, you have to do fun, weird things. And, you know, sometimes we take the debt and we give it to charity, or we do a happy hour, whatever we want to do with it. But if somebody comes to me and says, Well, hey, I'm going to be late for standup every day. Here's 20 bucks. I'm just getting let's talk ECFR what's going on? Oh, well, my kids get on the bus late or I can't adjust this my great. I'm sure the team will understand that. Hey, team next retro, can we move the standup five minutes because he's got a personal situation where he has to get his kids on the bus now. All right. So all those things are the things you have to do as a servant leader to listen for? And then figure out okay, what's the countermeasure is you know, how do we talk about it? Remember, okay,

remember that HR?

So, yes?

So the question is, how do we basically keep an audit log? How do we remember what happened in the past? Most of this stuff doesn't matter. I'm not getting audited on running my company, right? In other words, what the sales funnel looks like on a given day, or are our people's improvements are going those things projects a little, maybe a little bit different, right? So Scrum teams projects lean, we'll take pictures of the wall, and we'll check them in with GitHub, we'll check them in our source code. Often pictures are actually more credible to an auditor than a software tool. Because you aren't faking it, you're taking a picture on a wall, it's got a timestamp, you put it in, and you're like, yeah, it might be a little traceability might be a little bit hard. But we're checking in with the code that we put it in. So we do, we, I typically though, I will hire an administrative person on a large scrum team. And I say 12 to 20 people, not six, seven or eight, not the normal scrum side, but I believe in larger teams because of flow and Kanban. But anyway, so yeah, we'll archives necessary, often, you know, meet with the auditor at front, here's how we work, what do we need to make you happy? Can I take a picture and check it in? Can I take a picture and email it to you like, what would I need to do to pass your requirements? It doesn't have to be in a fancy software tool. Yes.

So now a presentation most of the terms like visual management on PC do have another agenda, themes as to what's the difference between the normal agenda line? And then.

So the question was, isn't it agile and lean? So Agile is a set of values and principles? Lean has a set of values and principles, Extreme Programming does? Right? They're all good things. In fact, your company's values and principles are good thing. I like to think that Agile and Lean are extremely similar. Except I think that that agile, put more emphasis on the product owner side of things, because a lot of lean manufacturing was the manufacturing process. You go back to the history. So you know, I think I think lean, lean and agile together. What makes it work right? That's what me or at least one is because we're you have to have the notion of eliminate waste, versus going through the ceremonies and doing the cards and doing the work. So I think that Agile Scrum agile was not enough that with Kanban, Trumbo and lean thinking Lean principles, you just have to create create a continual learning environment really what I want, I don't walk into a company, a company and judge them, were you lean or are you agile, I can walk in and I can listen. And if I hear a whole bunch of people collaborating, who are happy, and talking through what they're doing, and pairing, you have a high performing team, because it's not the typing is the hard part. It's solving the problem. And if I'm talking through whether I'm writing an email or writing code or designing something, and I have bright minds collaborating to reduce waste, and get things done faster, and I don't see the blame game, I seem T shaped people flowing downstream that eliminated current straight in the system, call it agile called Lean. I don't care if it's a high performing team. So you know, I think I just like to think about high performing teams more than anything, you know, when you see it. Right. And you'll know in a second I can walk in, I don't care if you check off every practice you're doing. If I walk in and that buzz isn't in that room. It's not You're not doing the right practices. You don't have the right culture. You might be doing the practices but you don't have the culture is once you get the culture, you can't fight the culture is what what makes it work. Okay, any more questions? All right. Thank you all very much. Thank you
